**A character analysis; docu-drama style**

*Who are you?*

"Well, my name is Nis and I'm twenty-two-years-old."

*Are you a boy or a girl?*

"That's a bit of an odd question... I'm a girl. I certainly hope you could tell. I try not to to look *too* strange."

*What **do** you look like?*

"Isn't that what this camera thing is for? I'm 5'7" with what I guess you could call a slender build. I have rather light-colored hair with brown eyes. My hair doesn't have eyes. That's not what I meant. Erm... I usually wear a short, white cloak--it's more like a jacket--with a red hood that marks me as a Fledgling. Past that, I wear gray pants with light boots. Functionality is great."

*Do you have a family?*

"I do! Just a mom and a dad. I don't see them much though because they're Pinion. That's probably the main motivation for me becoming a Pinion. In the meantime, I've unofficially adopted my Serif, Kyt, as a father/brother...person. He's pretty great."

*What do you like to do?*

"I love swordplay. Kyt teaches me, but not as often as I'd like. Other than that, I spend most of my time wandering the city. The colors and sounds help me think."
