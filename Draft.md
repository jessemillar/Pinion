The streets flew by in a blur of color. Nis adored the city, especially in the morning. Talon was breathtakingly beautiful, but there was no time to think. She was late.

Peddlers advertised their wares from all sides as she sprinted through the marketplace. Two streets over, a band played rhythmic music. She found herself reflexively quickening her pace to match the percussion.

Rounding a corner, hundreds of vibrant cloaks milled about blocking her path. The blood red hood that marked Nis as a Fledgling flapped in the crisp air as she wove through traffic.

Clearing the roadblock, she broke into a run and almost collided with a hidden sales display. A cluster of caged foxes yelped in surprise. Reeling, she blundered into a middle-aged man in a blue robe. She stopped for only a moment.

"S'cuse me! Sorry!" she called over her shoulder at a full sprint.

***

"Did you bring me a fishy stick?" Kyt asked with a grin as Nis breathlessly burst through the door.

"Sorry I'm late, Kyt." she gasped, a guilty look on her face. "I overslept."

"I figured as much," he chuckled. "Did you eat breakfast?" Nis shook her head. "It's a special day. We can't have you practicing on an empty stomach!" Kyt winked as he procured a bright yellow muffin from beneath his cloak. He tossed the treat in Nis' direction.

"Ready for swordplay?" he asked. Nis' meal was gone in two bites.

"Is that a question? I've been waiting all week for this!" she beamed.

***

Kyt's sword whistled through the air. Nis barely raised her blade in time to deflect the attack.

"Good! Now faster!" Kyt urged as he advanced on his Fledgling's fumbling steps. "You're off balance!" He directed his blade in a sweeping arc toward Nis' face. She yelped and fell on her back into the sand.

"Too slow!" Kyt slashed toward her torso. Nis rolled sideways at the last moment and leapt to her feet as sand sprayed from the sword's impact.

Lungs protesting, Nis desperately lunged toward her Serif. He sidestepped, parried her blade, and tapped her back with his weapon as she passed. Out of breath, Nis fell to her knees behind him.

"Good job, Nis. You're improving," Kyt said with a smile as he dusted his training weapon. Nis stood.

"We're done?" she almost whined as sweat trickled down her temple, her golden hair sticking to her forehead at odd angles.

"It looks like you are!" Kyt chuckled and sheathed his blade. "Besides, swordplay isn't the only thing that makes today special."

"What do you mean?" Nis asked, wiping her face with the hem of her coat. Kyt began to walk toward the edge of the arena.

***

"Will it hurt?" Nis asked her Serif.

"Just enough to remember," Kyt replied in his oddly-soothing voice. "The Dusk is not permitted to kill. Do not misunderstand, it is meant to kill, but there are ancient...seals in place to prevent it."

"The true test," he said, putting his arm around Nis' shoulders, "is to not let the Dusk kill your spirit. Your spirit, the driving force inside you, is your most precious posession."

Kyt led Nis through familiar corridors toward the practice grounds. "The Beckoning helps Fledglings realize their potential," he finished as he lobbed a practice sword into Nis' hand. "You like potential, right?" he asked with a grin.

***

"Ow..." Nis whimpered as she babied her finger. Kyt gestured for her hand and spent a moment examining it. Nis winced and reflexively jerked her hand back.

"That's a broken finger if I've ever seen one," Kyt said. "You shouldn't block swords with your hand!"

"Thanks for the tip," Nis glared at her Serif.

He chuckled. "Normally, Serifs don't teach Fledglings Prenen until after swordplay is mastered, but this is a perfect opportunity," he explained. "We're already far enough from the city anyway."

"I thought only Pinions could use Prenen magic..." Nis said.

"That's true. Not even Serif can use Prenen. But you are a Fledgling Pinion. Fledglings are fully capable of magic."

"Okay... How does it work?" she asked, glancing skeptically at her hand.

"Prenen is an emotional magic relying on will. It's real use lies in defense and healing. In order for your will to affect the elements around you, you have to have real feelings regarding the situation you're in," Kyt explained. "The more intense your feeling, the more intense the magic."

"How do I have 'real feeling?'" she asked skeptically.

"You care about your finger, right?" Kyt asked. Nis nodded. "A broken finger isn't the end of the world, but it does mean the end of sword training for the day. If you care enough to continue, fix your finger. Care about the outcome. That's what 'real feeling' means."

"Okay. I'll try," Nis took a last look at her finger, and closed her eyes.

Twenty minutes later, her finger was still throbbing.

"This isn't working, Kyt," Nis said in an exasperated tone.

"I would have been surprised if you'd succeeded. Let's try the real method." Kyt pulled a small dagger from beneath his cloak, exposed the blade, and ripped the weapon across his hand. Blood smattered the ground. He looked at the bone showing through the deep gash in his palm and winced as his blood began to flow freely.

Nis bolted to her feet. "Kyt! What are you doing?!"

Kyt's face began to whiten from the pain. "Teaching. What are you going to do about it?" he asked weakly as he knelt down too quickly.

Having forgotten her finger, Nis rushed to Kyt's side, reflexively clutched his gushing hand in hers, closed her eyes, and tried to will the elements in her Serif's palm to reform. One second passed, then two, then five. Nis began to hyperventilate.

"It's not working, Kyt!" she said, opening her eyes. Panic was evident in her voice.

"Relax," Kyt instructed as he clumsily lowered himself to the ground. His skin grew colder. Nis gulped and clamped her eyes shut.

"Please, please, please...!" she muttered under her breath. She felt her mind shift. Her life was, very suddenly, totally devoted to one thing; Kyt.

The crown of her head began to tingle. The feeling spread until it encompassed her face. A warm comfort shot down and back up her spine. Nis's eyes flew open in time to watch her hands begin to glow. Nis gasped as a chill spread through her frame and Kyt's wound slowly sealed itself. The glow faded.

Moments later, Kyt's eye's flitted open. "Good job," Kyt said weakly as the color returned to his cheeks. He smiled. Tears danced on Nis' eyelashes as she tightly embraced her Serif.

"Does your finger still hurt?" Kyt asked as he slowly sat up. Nis flexed her hand and began to grin.

"Why are you always so eager to fence, Nis?"

***

"There's a page near the end of my father's journal that's always sent shivers down my spine. It was the last thing he wrote before his death."

An etherial creature seeming to stem from old wives' tales. A strange medley of nightmare and memory. No one knows its origin. No one knows its form. It arrives only at dusk, but always at dusk, no matter your location. It is the Dusk.

It does not haunt everyone. It picks one individual and attempts to destroy their ability. It may be controlled by an outside force, but there's no way to know.

***

The sun had begun to dip below the treeline casting a warm glow over the forest floor. Nis winced pitifully as she slowly regained consciousness. The rustle of crunching leaves beneath her tunic went unheard by her ringing ears. Her eyes opened.

Nis' hand went to her forehead and came back warm and sticky. She groaned. Her ankle was swollen. She sighed again and groped for her fallen sword. She stood as her bloodied knuckles closed around the hilt of the blade.

"Too fast," she muttered as her vision faded dangerously. She struggled to remember as she regained balance. She had accidentally stumbled across the Dusk. This time it hadn't tried to mask itself. Another fight had ensued. The Dusk won the high ground. A blade-like claw capped off the memory. The world had gone black from pain.

"Dusk..." she muttered under her breath. One more sigh and Nis was limping through the brush.

Many injuries over many days had forced Nis to polish her Prenen. As she walked, she almost reflexively willed the elements in her ankle to realign. Before she reached the camp, she was moving at a comfortable jog.

***

Nis sighed as she thought back on the length of the day. She'd made it a good seven miles toward the mountain, but they were hard miles. She'd almost lost her boots to the swamp and the humidity was beginning to rot her rations.

She forced herself to think positively as she stoked the small fire she'd managed to put together.

Gin, her fleurescent green companion, hovered obediently behind her. Gin was a Prenen summon. He never spoke. Nis was not even sure if he was a "he," but she had taken to keeping him around in the name of having some sort of company. She had come to appreciate Prenen's ability to sustain a summon without constantly drawing on her own energy. 

"How're you holding up, Nis?" Nis spun to face the camp intruder. Gin turned a protective, deeper green.

"Kyt?!" Nis squealed. "What are you doing here?" She sheathed her blade and ran to him as he emerged from the bushes. She almost embraced him but Gin held her back.

"I wanted to come check on you. You've been out here for a while," Kyt responded with a perfect smile.

"I thought you weren't allowed to come see me?" she asked. "Fledglings have to complete the Beckoning alone..."

"The Pinion made an exception!" Kyt said throwing his hands in the air. "Isn't that great news?" he smiled and locked eyes with her as he walked toward the fire.

"I suppose it is great," Nis responded as she followed. "I've been pretty lonely out here of late. I've been missing you."

"Lonely? Why? Aren't you working? If you were doing your job correctly, you wouldn't have time to be lonely," Kyt frowned. "What have you been doing, Nis? Slacking?"

Nis' eyes widened and she looked at the ground ashamedly.

"Didn't I teach you better than that?" Kyt stood, eyes still locked on his Fledgling. Nis felt her face begin to flush as she looked up.

"I come out here because of you, tell you I've missed you, and this is how you greet me?" she asked with a waver in her voice.

Kyt simply laughed and warmed his hands by the flames, still watching her.

Something wasn't right.

Nis slowly moved her hand toward the hilt of her sword. Kyt's eyes narrowed and his expression hardened. Gin turned a deeper green.

Suddenly, Kyt snarled and lunged for Nis. Her eyes flew open in shock as she reflexively drew her blade and stumbled away from her Serif.

"You're not Kyt!" she yelled as Gin's protective figure swooped between her and the attacker. She shook off her approaching tears and dropped into combat stance. "Who are you?"

The imposter's eyes turned 

***

Nis washed herself in a stream.

"It's been quite a while," Nis said more to herself than Gin.

She didn't know why the Dusk kept disguising itself. She knew full well that the only ones here were her and the creature.
